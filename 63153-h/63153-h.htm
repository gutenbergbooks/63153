<p class="t3">
  <i>Portrait in the Royal Ontario Museum</i><br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  Cun-ne-wa-bum&mdash;"one who looks on stars"&mdash;<br />
  (Feel the singing wind from out the western hills)<br />
  "The tip-end of a swan's wing is her fan,<br />
  With a handle of porcupine quills."<br />
  Here is the artist's name, Paul Kane;<br />
  Painting in forty-seven, at Edmonton, I see.<br />
  That was when prairies were untamed,<br />
  And untamed this young Cree.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What an incantation in her name!<br />
  Magic as her dark face underneath the stars;<br />
  There is sword-like wind about it wrapped,<br />
  And echoes of old wars.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Cun-ne-wa-bum!<br />
  When turtle shells were rattling,<br />
  And the drums beat for the dance<br />
  In the great hall of the Factor's house till dawn,<br />
  You sat without the door,<br />
  Where the firelight on the floor<br />
  Caught the red of beads upon your moccasins.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At evening through the grassy plains the wind<br />
  Came shouting down the world to meet the dawn,<br />
  And with the wind the firelight rose and fell,<br />
  Answered with flame his shrill barbaric yell,<br />
  And died like whining fiddles at his feet.<br />
  And through it all the constant sound of drums&mdash;<br />
  Did your feet move to drums?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The men from near and far,<br />
  Crees and Sarcees,<br />
  And a Blackfoot brave or two,<br />
  Made rhythm of a dance that moves like rhyme<br />
  To the rush of wind, and rattles swung in time<br />
  To the constant, constant, constant beat of drums.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No Indian woman dances in the light;<br />
  Silent they sit together out of sight.<br />
  But to-night I think this artist from the East,<br />
  Who had come to paint the natives hereabout,<br />
  Found a splendid flare of crimson on the feast<br />
  And moved near the open door,<br />
  Where the firelight on the floor<br />
  Caught the red of beads upon your moccasins.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So it is, O Cun-ne-wa-bum,<br />
  Who were wont to look on stars,<br />
  That you sit for ever here,<br />
  Like a wild lost note from far,<br />
  From the days of ancient war<br />
  And of towered stockade and guns<br />
  In the Edmonton of seventy years ago.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In your buckskin and your beads<br />
  (Feel the sudden wind from out the western hills)<br />
  The tip-end of a swan's wing for your fan<br />
  With a handle of porcupine quills.<br />
</p>

  BALLAD OF JASPER ROAD<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I know a Blackfoot Chief<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose name is Dark Plume Bill.<br />
  He lived beside the Jasper Road&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lives there still.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He wears a queer checked coat<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a grey bowler hat,<br />
  But looks his ninety-seven years<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all of that.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  His gaze is unconcerned<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sits in the sun,<br />
  And counts the flashing motor-cars<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pass, one-by-one,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And trucks, like dreary monsters<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a prehistoric day,<br />
  That are rushing down the road<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their crazy way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The first Red River cart,"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Dark Plume Bill to me,<br />
  "Came lurching up the prairie<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a ship at sea."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  (Oh, the long blue road,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stealthy pad of feet<br />
  And the first patient ox-cart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its sail-like sheet!)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then the carts came faster,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the time of snow<br />
  We camped outside the Palisade,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy years ago.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Arrows, guns&mdash;big Buffalo hunts,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much long fight,<br />
  And fires to warm the tepees<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the feasts at night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But when they laid the steel<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the long trail awoke<br />
  My Indian tribe had scattered<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the wigwam smoke."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  His gaze was unconcerned,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he scanned the way he knew,<br />
  As though from out its clamour<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had found a vanished clew.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And I thought it must be strange<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit in the sun<br />
  And look upon an ancient road<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you had seen begun<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Out of silence and mystery<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crafty, ambushed death,<br />
  Come alive with men, and monsters<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such an alien breath.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  (Oh, the long blue road<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stealthy pad of feet<br />
  And the first patient ox-cart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its sail-like sheet!)<br />

  BUFFALO MEAT
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  <i>A Daughter-in-law Writes</i><br />
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p class="poem">
  It takes a letter sixty days to go&mdash;<br />
  An Indian boy runs down the trail to-night.<br />
  What shall I write to you?<br />
  My mind is full of gossip of a town<br />
  That you have never dreamed of.<br />
  So&mdash;shall I tell you of our shacks,<br />
  Huddled behind the tall stockade?<br />
  Our guns, with muzzles set against the prairie?<br />
  What if I write the truth!<br />
  Your son is now a savage;<br />
  By that much more I love him!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If I should say<br />
  I can stand all this tropic, summer heat<br />
  And menial tasks and crowded alleyways,<br />
  And fat squaws lounging in the sun,<br />
  And even water out of tainted wells,<br />
  And long, rough prairie rides&mdash;<br />
  All for the sake of autumn,<br />
  And its short, magic days of pure content!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If you could know my mind!<br />
  A little British mind two years ago;<br />
  To-day a sort of crowded, pagan scroll,<br />
  Recording strange old customs<br />
  And legends, various as the Indian tribes,<br />
  And prayers and songs and dances.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Songs that are old as earth itself,<br />
  Dances as elemental:<br />
  Skin drums and tom-toms,<br />
  Rattles of turtle shell, and whirl of winds<br />
  Against the amphitheatre of hills.<br />
  You will remember they were playing Sheridan<br />
  When we left London!<br />
  I can count every lilac spray on the old drawing room chintz.<br />
  I hope&mdash;I hope you have not changed it since!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let me begin again.<br />
  If I should say<br />
  I love this small, rough shack,<br />
  For it has made me brave&mdash;<br />
  Braver, at least, than when I saw it first,<br />
  And saw a sea of prairie<br />
  And the dim forms of buffalo herds<br />
  Darkening the far horizon!<br />
  I am braver now than when the halfbreeds came<br />
  Racing towards us on that first wild day,<br />
  Mad messengers to frighten us to death&mdash;<br />
  Servants of trappers and the Nor'-west men&mdash;<br />
  Those halfbreeds! feathers dangling, tomahawks!<br />
  That was in summer.<br />
  Still the buffalo lingered,<br />
  Cropping the blue-grey grasses,<br />
  Plunging in the muddy wallows,<br />
  Always near us.<br />
  I could almost touch a shaggy flank.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Two years ago to-day, in Piccadilly&mdash;<br />
  That tea-shop place the day before we sailed<br />
  He said, "It may be wild enough out there,<br />
  But I shall keep you safe&mdash;<br />
  Oh, I shall keep you safe!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We loitered through that first bright autumn<br />
  And on the edge of winter had no meat.<br />
  Who wants meat, here, must follow it&mdash;and kill.<br />
  So, like a band of pilgrims, we set out&mdash;<br />
  Unguarded women are not left behind&mdash;<br />
  Walking beside our husbands all the way.<br />
  Far out of sight, the Indians<br />
  Search for the roaming herds.<br />
  They are on splendid ponies.<br />
  We settlers are the country's parasites.<br />
  When Mary Scott, the factor's wife, and I,<br />
  With two young squaws, were left a day in camp<br />
  We learned an incantation.<br />
  Another day when we were on the trail<br />
  My wedding ring was taken from my hand<br />
  Just as a warning,<br />
  A little necessary bright horse-play,<br />
  To show us who was master.<br />
  Five days of march and then the broad plateau&mdash;<br />
  White plains, brown beasts,<br />
  Red, flying figures of the Indian guides,<br />
  Bonfires at night and sleep in soft skin bags,<br />
  Warm blood of slaughter&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But&mdash;<br />
  It takes a letter sixty days to go,<br />
  Even at this season, when there is no snow.<br />
  Autumn has fallen on London.<br />
  I can see you in the sweet old room.<br />
  Please do not change a thing until I come!<br />
  Fires will be lit, your velvet curtains drawn,<br />
  And when you read my letter, dearest one,<br />
  Pray that some great day I may have a son<br />
  To mingle past with present.<br />
  For now each treacherous hour seems all of life;<br />
  I am as much a hunter as a wife,<br />
  To whom the summer is a breathing space,<br />
  Who waits for autumn<br />
  And trots beside her husband, through the grass<br />
  That shudders in the late November wind,<br />
  Or lies like frozen foam beneath our feet,<br />
  Looking for buffalo meat!<br />
</p>

  RETURN OF THE TRAPPERS
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Against the rolling snowdrifts,<br />
  Misted by the frost-fog,<br />
  Dwarfish, pigmy figures,<br />
  See them come!<br />
  Open the gates of the great stockade,<br />
  Welcome them home.<br />
  There's my Red-Scarf!<br />
  I can almost hear him snarling,<br />
  "Marche!  Marche!"<br />
  Down at old Fort Garry,<br />
  I have heard them say<br />
  That they take the women,<br />
  Who dog-trot behind them<br />
  All the way.<br />
  Not out here!  Not out here!<br />
  With the glass at minus forty<br />
  Half the year!<br />
  There's the first big husky&mdash;<br />
  Think you hear his bell?<br />
  That is Henri leading;<br />
  Yes, among a thousand halfbreeds,<br />
  I would know his yell!<br />
  What you bet the sleds hold?<br />
  There's a slide!<br />
  Why that drift the other day<br />
  Stretched a half mile wide.<br />
  What you bet the sleds hold?<br />
  Fire the gun!<br />
  Here the women come, pell mell.<br />
  They've got ears, those Indian women,<br />
  Not much need to fire the gun!<br />
  Now we're in for days of steeping,<br />
  Matching, drying, sorting&mdash;rum.<br />
  Hear the whips crack!<br />
  Hi!  Hi!<br />
  See, that's Henri!<br />
  Three, four, five&mdash;<br />
  Not one train lost.<br />
  Here they come!<br />

  AN OLD LADY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Madame de Courament excels at Bridge.<br />
  Hers is a clever hand,<br />
  Coloured with age and wrinkled;<br />
  But beautiful and tapering too,<br />
  Quite in accord with this old, stately room,<br />
  With crystal chandeliers,<br />
  And flowers and the warm tapestry of books.<br />
  Silent the cards fall.<br />
  Down the long avenue a dog howls at the moon,<br />
  A far, frost-sharpened sound.<br />
  The wind swirls up a little storm of snow<br />
  That blows against the casement.<br />
  A skilled opponent, Madame makes few mistakes<br />
  Like that a moment since,<br />
  When suddenly the dog howled&mdash;and we lost a trick.<br />
  She has a flashing wit,<br />
  Dinners at Rideau Hall are incomplete without her.<br />
  As someone said the other day,<br />
  "These elderly, elaborate folk<br />
  Are like a passing pageantry,<br />
  Gorgeous and of another day."<br />
  Silent the cards fall.<br />
  Again the far-off dog howls at the moon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An hour later, "Chateau Laurier" she told the chauffeur.<br />
  And, alert and gay,<br />
  Wrapped in her sables,<br />
  She was motoring me the long white way to town<br />
  And gossiping of little this and that.<br />
  But just as we were nearing city lights<br />
  She said, "I saw you noticed that dog's bark.<br />
  It sounded almost like a wolf's;<br />
  It took me back to the Red River days.<br />
  Oh, it was fifty years ago, my dear;<br />
  I was as young as you ... It seems like yesterday.<br />
  Hardships!  I loved it all!<br />
  Even the wolves, baying far out of sight,<br />
  Failed to disturb our rest<br />
  When we were safe at home.<br />
  The Indians were quite friendly&mdash;<br />
  And the eternal glamour of the snow!<br />
  And yet to-night, just when I heard that sound,<br />
  Sharpened by frost,<br />
  I felt an old pain strike me,<br />
  The knife-like thrust, before a child is born.<br />
  I was alone that night.<br />
  My husband had been called to Edmonton,<br />
  My Indian maid had let her family in<br />
  Looking for whiskey.<br />
  I dared not call to her.<br />
  For hours the Indians danced and sang and yelled.<br />
  I watched them from my icy-cold bedroom<br />
  Through great cracks in the floor.<br />
  Before they slept they sat crouched by the fire,<br />
  As I crouched up above in fright and pain.<br />
  And all night long I heard the wolves;<br />
  They kept a sort of savage company<br />
  With my own stifled cries.<br />
  To-night, my mind went back a moment strangely&mdash;<br />
  I always thought he had the sweetest face<br />
  Of any of my seven ... But then he was the first!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She raised her glittering hand<br />
  And found the speaking tube, to modify her chauffeur's pace.<br />
  "And that, my dear, was fifty years ago," she said.<br />
  "The prairie was a very different place&mdash;<br />
  I never thought, then, I should come to Bridge!"<br />

  As they sailed in their rickety death-traps;<br />
  They laughed as they rode,<br />

  She can laugh and jest too,<br />
  Play and wine and dine;<br />
  But none of these things have wooed me,<br />
  Bound me close by a mystery,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made her eternally mine.<br />
  For we have found still places<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the wood;<br />
  Climbed a ledge of grey rock<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a pink-legged heron stood;<br />
  Heard the distant loon's cry;<br />
  Watched a lonely bird fly&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she does not stir then,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not turn to me then,<br />

  When from the rocklands of the Georgian Bay<br />
  Or through the bush roads whence we came to-day,<br />
  But then on foot, soft-padding all the way,<br />
  Or in the war canoes<br />
  They crowded to this small blue lake of theirs<br />
  And an old shrine ...<br />
  What are we floating towards<br />
  In this small, low canoe?<br />
  A naked, ceremonial singing past<br />
  Seems to reach out and whisper.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Once in the twilight aisles of Amiens<br />
  I thought I knew what shadows were,<br />
  Creeping in golden dust and greying dust,<br />
  And trooping down dim flights of measured air,<br />
  Liquid in spacing, that those arches span.<br />

  But just last night, before the moon was up,<br />
  Our little boat stole close against these crags<br />
  That out-rear arches and reject the dark.<br />
  Yet gradually the purple of the rock<br />
  Melted before it; and again they came<br />
  Creeping in golden dust, and greying dust,<br />
  And crowding down those giant flights of stair<br />
  That open slowly as eternity,<br />
  To hold the feet of shadows, lost in night.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Then I remembered Götterdammerüng&mdash;<br />
  How before doom falls on the gorgeous host,<br />
  Slowly there drifts across the empty stage<br />
  A smoke-cloud, lonely as a passing soul.<br />
  In very truth the gods return to you&mdash;<br />
  Great rock that blazes colour in the sun&mdash;<br />
  And, as in the Valhalla of old song,<br />
  Parade before our eyes the whole day long<br />
  And make a glorious end,<br />
  As with you they are folded in a sleep.<br />
  No cloud foretells their doom, but wings of birds<br />
  A moment sweep your side&mdash;then fall away.<br />

  NORTHERN GRAVEYARDS<br />

<p class="poem">
  Stony fields and lonely roads,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagre hamlets, very lean,<br />
  And most prosperous graveyards<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying all between.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Each few miles a graveyard,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its crouching column<br />
  And its urns and headstones,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very dark and solemn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But with what an accent!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow, purple, red,<br />
  Lie the votive offerings<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this public dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Close beside the railway,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the smoke drifts high,<br />
  These are decked in garlands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the passerby.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Even in the winter,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking through the snow<br />

<p class="poem">
  They are strangely cheerful,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these plots of ground<br />
  That have lost the loneliness<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the living. Here abound<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In a comradeship increasing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who in their hour<br />
  Reaped a dreary harvest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missed a magic flower.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Over them the smoke-wreaths,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow, and whispering grass,<br />
  And the voice of neighbours,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing as they pass;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  While the urns of iron<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the barbarous vases<br />
  Chant a willing ritual<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To forgotten faces.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So they sleep together,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their shades may say:<br />
  "Wave to us, O restless traveller!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad to stay."<br />

  STONY LAKE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  By southern seas I have seen purple stones<br />
  Throw back the shadows of the waves and hills.<br />
  On the Ægean, so the stories run,<br />
  Greek youths, with many a saffron-coloured sail,<br />
  Rode flame-like to the rhythm of the gale.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Again, on the bright shores of this small lake,<br />
  Purple of hills and pink of northern rocks.<br />
  To-day I met a sail-boat in the wind<br />
  And at its mast a brown Canadian boy&mdash;<br />
  He was as splendid as his mate of Troy.<br />

  TRADE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  It might have been two hundred years ago,<br />
  For all the difference in her way or mine,<br />
  That her canoe, with paddle dipping slow,<br />
  Just as the sunset ran to embers low,<br />
  Stopped at my rocky door.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With fish and basketwork she plied her trade,<br />
  And I, to help a little money last,<br />
  Answered her barter with a coat I made<br />
  Of coloured wool&mdash;oh, many seasons past!<br />
  We were both satisfied!<br />

  SNAKE ISLAND<br />

<p class="poem">
  "Ages ago," my Indian says<br />
  (As we are fishing in a cove<br />
  Of this green island, with its trees and shacks),<br />
  "Here was wild grass and many snakes.<br />
  After a while they disappear,<br />
  For soon the white man comes, and makes<br />
  Houses like these to live in!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So the old name is suddenly made new.<br />
  Snake Island! ...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ages ago, perhaps, the trees were elfin<br />
  And tall grass towered to the skies,<br />
  Until, to all those narrow, screen-like eyes,<br />
  This was a dazzling fen,<br />
  Perplexed with tangled fern,<br />
  Peopled with glittering prey;<br />
  Dense borderland to where the black pools lay<br />
  Whose captives twist and turn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Burrowing, boa-like, harlequin snakes,<br />
  Your day was brilliant and flashing enough!<br />
  Snakes casting skins in continuous slough,<br />
  Grass snakes and ring snakes, on dragon-flies bent.<br />
  Was there a charmer, with musical pipe,<br />
  Lured you a moment?  Some Indian charm<br />
  Surely touched you with sorcery, gave you alarm,<br />
  Ere the people who meant to build houses like these<br />
  Came and killed you&mdash;<br />
  And killed the wild grass.<br />

  There is a little tent among the birches<br />
  Since yesterday.<br />
  Those birches are the palest things<br />
  Even in the morning sun!<br />
  Among them the tent has suddenly blossomed,<br />
  As the white flower of a night-blooming cereus,<br />
  Silently, deep in some forest of sleep,<br />

  Who are they?  What dreams must be theirs,<br />
  Who have found such a magical camp unawares?<br />

  Death does not come creeping<br />
  As it comes to men;<br />

  All the green walls of your silence<br />

  MIRACLES<br />

<p class="poem">
  We said: "The Universe shall kneel!"<br />
  And so the dreams of long ago<br />
  Have bound the winds and stars,<br />
  And lashed the waves to giant bars,<br />
  Till Light itself is chained.<br />
  We fly on wings of steel;<br />
  We beckon Mars.<br />
  Almost the frightened worlds, I feel,<br />
  Must in their journeys swerve and wheel<br />
  Far from the Will of Earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Suppose the Universe should speak!<br />
  And on some thundering street<br />
  Quite suddenly, before our eyes<br />
  A fountain, cool and sweet,<br />
  A careless, laughing little thing<br />
  Should dance upon the air<br />
  And all the very wise of us<br />
  Be held in wonder there! ...<br />
  Suppose one day an angel,<br />
  Through some caprice or whim,<br />
  Should walk along a city way<br />
  That we might talk to him;<br />
  And all the men and women,<br />
  And all the horses too,<br />
  Should bow and fall before him,<br />
  As mortals used to do! ...<br />
  I wish that some quaint miracle<br />
  Might happen, even to-day,<br />
  Whereby the Universe should speak<br />
  And men kneel down to pray.<br />
